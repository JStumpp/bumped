# .version

If you're not sure what the current synchronized version across your configuration files, then run `bumped version`:

```bash
$ bumped version

info	: Current version is '1.0.0'.
```

The shared version is the major version detected in them. On the other hand, it will not be syncrhonized until the next release.
